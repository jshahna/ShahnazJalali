## Featured Projects

### [Dinosaur Fossil Record Insights](https://github.com/jshahna/Dinosaur-Fossil-Record-Insights/blob/main/Dinosaurs-fossil-insights.ipynb)

In this project, I explored **dinosaur diversity** and **evolution** using the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#/). By leveraging Python and libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, I performed an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. My work uncovered key trends such as the distribution of dinosaur species over time and tested hypotheses on the evolutionary growth of dinosaurs.

**Key skills demonstrated:**
- Data cleaning & handling missing data
- Trend analysis & visualization
- Evolutionary biology insights through data

This project was the **capstone** of my Certificate program at the **University of Washington**, where I collaborated with a team to develop machine learning algorithms and **predict house prices** in King County. Our focus was on identifying the most important features influencing house prices and building robust predictive models. 

**Key skills demonstrated:**
- Feature engineering & selection
- Building machine learning regression models
- Collaborative project execution & presentation
