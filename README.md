In this project, I analyzed various factors influencing student performance and outcomes, using the [Kaggle Student Alcohol Consumption dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption/data). This dataset, derived from a survey of **secondary school** students enrolled in a **Portuguese language course**, provides valuable insights into social, gender, and study-related aspects of students' lives. 

My dashboard presents a clear and interactive overview of the **data distribution** and highlights the **impact of key factors** such as gender, study time, internet access, parental education, parental marital status, and alcohol consumption on students' academic outcomes.

**Key skills demonstrated:**
- Data visualization with Tableau
- Analyzing relationships between variables
- Dashboard creation and storytelling

In this project, I explored **dinosaur diversity** and **evolution** using the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#/). By leveraging Python and libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**, I performed an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. My work uncovered key trends such as the distribution of dinosaur species over time and tested hypotheses on the evolutionary growth of dinosaurs.

**Key skills demonstrated:**
- Data cleaning & handling missing data
- Trend analysis & visualization
- Evolutionary biology insights through data

This project was the **capstone** of my Certificate program at the **University of Washington**, where I collaborated with a team to develop machine learning algorithms and **predict house prices** in King County. Our focus was on identifying the most important features influencing house prices and building robust predictive models. 

**Key skills demonstrated:**
- Feature engineering & selection
- Building machine learning regression models
- Collaborative project execution & presentation
